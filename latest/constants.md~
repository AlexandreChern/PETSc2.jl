# Constants

```@meta
CurrentModule = PETSc
```

Many PETSc constants and enums are available in the Julia wrappers.  The full
list can be found in `src/petsc_constants.jl`.  See the PETSc documentation for
their meaning.
A few of the most important constants are listed here.  Not all of the
constants are exported from the `PETSc` module, to avoid cluttering the
user's namespace.
